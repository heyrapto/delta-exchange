Critical:
1. The calls has an orange border that reaches the strikecell in that same row when active (see image attached)
2. Buy/sell buttons positioning

Must DO:
1. Effect on input changes i.e period and values must have effect on the chart in real time.
2. Update trade-card input fields
3. I keep seeing "wrong network" on the custom connect button
4. We need to update logic for amount as it was changed from quantitiy in trade card
