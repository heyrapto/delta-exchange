Critical:
1. The calls has an orange border that reaches the strikecell in that same row when active (see image attached)
2. Buy/sell buttons positioning

1. If we have things/functionalities in the FuturesTradePanel that are not availabe in the gnsGuide.md file (or gns does not offer) please remove them aas we do not want anything to cause issues or not make it work when trying to trade. i.e the Limit and market toggle. if none then skip

2. for positions in exchange-panel.tsx, add colors to the pnl.
red for negative green for positive

3. this in depth-chart has to be directly below the depth tab. (see image attached)
 {activeTab === "Depth" && (
        <div className="px-4 py-2 border-gray-300">
          <div className="flex items-center gap-3">
            <span className="text-xs text-gray-600">Depth</span>
            <div className="flex-1 max-w-[150px]">
              <Slider
                value={[depth]}
                onValueChange={(value) => setDepth(value[0])}
                className="bg-red-500"
                max={100}
                min={0}
                step={1}
              />
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
      )}
